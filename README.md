# KCD Raid Group :crossed_swords:

## Mission & What We Do :metal:
- Themed from MMORPG gaming, gamifiying Mob programming OSS repos :wink:
- Look for criteria in OSS repos 
  1. Low to medium contributor activity, only a handful of maintainers
  2. Medium to high usage of the OSS 
  3. Our impact can be potentially high; in a few days :stars:

## Joining KCD Raid Group :smiling_face_with_three_hearts:
1. Active Raid contributor
2. Active Community member (KCD) 
3. Determine responsibilities then set to either Org member or Collab (reduced permissions)

## The Process find target -> communicate -> Raid -> Push Code :fire:
1. One Target at a time to maximize impact in short amount of time.

## Communication :smiley:
1. Primarily www.kentcdodds.com/discord #oss-raid-group channel 
2. Projects tab per Repo we are working on, to kanban who is working on what to prevent redudant work or stepping on toes.

## Workflow :sunglasses:
