- Themed from MMORPG gaming, gamifiying Mob programming OSS repos
- Look for criteria in OSS repos 
  1. Low to medium contributor activity, only a handful of maintainers
  2. Medium to high usage of the OSS 
  3. Our impact can be potentially high; in a few days 

## The Process find target -> communicate -> Raid -> Push Code
