# Hi :wave:, Welcome to the OSS Raid Group :crossed_swords:

The OSS Raid Group is what happens when you combine MMORPGs, Programming, and Open Source Software - a group dedicated to defeating the Raid Bosses of OSS

For those who aren't aware of these 'gamer' terms, and even those that are; here are the definitions we use when operating as a Raid Group.

| Phrase    | Definition |
| --------- | ---------- |
| Raid      | A Raid is the OSS project's issue that we are working to resolve - see how we [converted react-hooks-testing-library to TypeScript](https://github.com/testing-library/react-hooks-testing-library/pull/520) for an example |
| Raid Boss | The Raid Boss is the issue that we are 'fighting' to resolve |

## Storyline Quest (mission) :scroll:

- Themed from MMORPG gaming, gamifiying Mob programming OSS repos
- Look for criteria in OSS repos 
  1. Low to medium contributor activity, only a handful of maintainers
  2. Medium to high usage of the OSS 
  3. Our impact can be potentially high; in a few days

## Join Us! :smiling_face_with_three_hearts::partying_face:
